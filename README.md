# Whatsapp-chat-analyzer
A project intended for Business Owners / Managers to analyze Whatsapp chats between their customer care executives and their cutomers.

#ü§ù Problem Statement
This project is intended for business owners who use Whatsapp as one of the communication channels to chat with their customers. Businesses generally hire customer care executives to talk to their cutomers and solve queries. As such, it becomes harder for Business Owner/ Manager to go through every conversation and analyse the chats. Thus, there comes this project where the Business Owner/ Manager downlaods the whatsapp chat and uploads in this project. After analysing the chat, it will return various insights and visualizations which helps the Business Owner / Manager to understand and figure out the main highlights & themes of the chat. Along with that, Business Owner / Manager can also analyze the group chats.
